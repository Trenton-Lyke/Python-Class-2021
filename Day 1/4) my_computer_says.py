    Homework 1: My Computer Says
    In most programming languages, like Python,
    you will be able to print out text in a window called
    the terminal (also called console or shell sometimes).

    To print text in python we use the print() function.
    Python will display the argument given to the function
    or in other words whatever we put between the parantheses
    of the function.
"""
#   1. Write some code using the print() function to display whatever you want
#      your computer to say in the terminal. Then run your code.
#      You can do this by saving the file, clicking the "Run" tab at 
#      the top, and then click the "Run Module" option drop in the down menu.

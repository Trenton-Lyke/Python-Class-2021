    Review 1: Python Rocks!
    In most programming languages, like Python,
    you will be able to print out text in a window called
    the terminal (also called console or shell sometimes).

    To print text in python we use the print() function.
    Python will display the argument given to the function
    or in other words whatever we put between the parantheses
    of the function.
"""
#   1. Write a line of code below to print 
#   out the phrase "Python Rocks!" in the terminal.
#   Note: You don't have to display the quotation marks (")
#   in the terminal if you don't want to.
#   Then run your code.
#   You can do this by saving the file, clicking the "Run" tab at 
#   the top, and then click the "Run Module" option in the drop down menu.

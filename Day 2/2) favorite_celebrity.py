    Activity 2: Favorite Celebrity
    In most programming languages, like Python,
    you will be able to save data in variables for
    later use. 

    Think of variables as being like boxes. You can
    put an item like a fan in a box now so 
    you can use the fan later. A variable is the same
    way just replace items with data.

    Also like a box, you can change what you store inside
    a variable. You could store a fan in a box and then
    decide to store a book in the box later on. The same
    goes with variables. You can store the name of your 
    favorite game as a child and then replace it with the
    name of your favorite game as an adult later.

    Here is the format to create a variable in Python:
    variable_name = value

    For example, the following statement would create a 
    variable named age with a value of 24:
    age = 24

    You can access the value in a variable by using the 
    variables name. For example to print the value in the
    age variable I can use the following code:
    print(age)
"""

# 1. Enter a description of your favorite celebrity or character
#    between the quotation marks (") in the line of code below
description = ""


# 2. The line of code above creates a variable named description
#    which currently holds the description of your favorite celebrity 
#    or character. Print the value in the description variable by
#    typing the name of the variable (aka description) between the
#    parentheses () of the print() function below
print()


# 3. Run your code to see what gets displayed in the terminal


# 4. Write a line of code to create a variable named title 
#    and give it a string value (text enclosed by quotation marks (")) 
#    where the text is the title of a movie, tv show, video game, etc. 
#    that your favorite celebrity was in. For example for Ryan Reynolds
#    I could write the code:
#    title = "Detective Pikachu"


# 5. Now uncomment the line of code below (remove the hashtag (#))
#print(title)


# 6. Run your code to see what gets displayed in the terminal


# 7. Write a line of code below to change the value of the variable named
#    title to a different string value. *hint creating a variable
#    and changing a variables value have the same format.


# 8. Now print the value in the title variable using the print() function
#    and the name of the title variable (aka title)


# 9. Run your code to see what gets displayed in the terminal
